I am currently a DPhil Computer Science student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) (at [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/)), supervised by professor [Thomas Lukasiewicz](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas.lukasiewicz/). I received a B.Sc degree in Industrial Management Engineering from Korea University in 2017 and earned an M.Eng degree in 2019 from the same affiliation, supervised by professor [Pilsung Kang](http://dsba.korea.ac.kr/professor/). Before returning to university, I worked for SK Telecom in Seoul, South Korea, as an NLP scientist & engineer from 2019 to 2020. During my DPhil study, I worked as a DPhil intern at Clifford Chance and J.P. Morgan Chase in London, United Kingdom.

I'm interested in investigating faulty behaviours of modern language models, especially in the inconsistent predictions of language models. My research also focuses on alleviating the issues from linguistic viewpoints to improve the trustworthiness of the language models. 

I enjoy swimming, weight training, archery, muay Thai, and watching films in my spare time.
