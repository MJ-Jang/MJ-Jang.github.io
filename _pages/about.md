Hi, I'm Takyoung Kim. Currently I am working at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab" target="_blank">NAVER AI Lab</a> as a research intern. I received my Master's degree at Korea University, advised by [Pilsung Kang](http://dsba.korea.ac.kr/professor/){:target="_blank"}.

My main research interest is focused on solving communicative problems in the *real-world*, including pointing out unrealistic assumptions in benchmark dataset and its evaluation. I'm also interested in multi-turn reasoning (e.g., dialogue system or question answering), knowledge-intensive NLP, and finding better sentence embeddings on domain-agnostic/specific situations. 

In my free time, I enjoy swimmingüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, soccer‚öΩÔ∏è, weight trainingüèãÔ∏è, and many other activities.
